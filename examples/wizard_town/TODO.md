# Main idea
You're a wizard student and have to learn 12 spells to complete
your graduation or wathever.

You will learn these spells by reading scrolls, which you can
obtain by completing "quests" for npcs or finding them somewhere.

There's 12 towns, 1 for each spell. Names ???
- Azalea town
- Beemoy town
- Citrus town
- Donkey town
- ...

The game is focused in dialog and completing quests, combat
isn't the main way of doing quests.

# Spells idea

# Poison or something
    The first spell may be poison, that you can get talking to a npc,
    which will give you this spell because you need to protect yourself
    from enemies. 
    Not meant to be weak.

# Capture spell
    # Way to get
      ???
    This spell you will use to capture small mobs.
    maybe putting them in a jar?

# ???
    This spell you can get by playing a card game with a npc, if you win
    you get the spell.

# ???
    You can get by finding a rare mob, capturing it and giving to a
    certain npc.
